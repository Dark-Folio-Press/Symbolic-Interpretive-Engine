# Astro-Interpretative-Engine

At its core, this project is an experiment in interpretive system design: how to encode symbolic literacy, restraint, and ethical boundaries into an AI-assisted application.

## Overview

The Astro-Interpretative-Engine is a symbolic interpretation system being developed by Dark Folio Press. This repository serves as a collaborative portfolio for prompt engineering documents, templates, and best practices focused on ethical, depth-oriented astrological interpretation.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

- **📚 Prompt Engineering Portfolio** - A comprehensive collection of prompts, templates, and examples
- **🧭 Symbolic Literacy Documentation** - Core concepts and theoretical foundations
- **⚖️ Ethical Guidelines** - Boundaries and best practices for responsible interpretation
- **📝 Templates** - Reusable prompt structures for various interpretation tasks
- **💡 Examples** - Both basic and advanced interpretation scenarios
- **🤝 Collaboration Guidelines** - How to contribute and share knowledge

## Quick Start

1. **New to this project?** Start with the [Prompt Portfolio README](prompts/README.md)
2. **Want to understand the foundations?** Read about [Symbolic Literacy](prompts/concepts/symbolic-literacy.md)
3. **Looking for templates?** Browse the [Templates](prompts/templates/) directory

## Core Principles

This project is built on foundational principles:

1. **Symbolic Literacy** - Deep understanding of symbolic systems and their meanings
2. **Ethical Restraint** - Thoughtful boundaries in interpretation and application
3. **Interpretive Depth** - Moving beyond surface-level analysis to meaningful insight
4. **Collaborative Evolution** - Continuous refinement through shared knowledge

## Use Cases

This prompt engineering portfolio supports:

- Astrological chart interpretation with depth and nuance
- Symbolic pattern recognition and analysis
- Archetypal exploration and integration
- Ethical AI-assisted divination and insight
- Educational resources for symbolic literacy
- Collaborative development of interpretation tools

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance our understanding and application of symbolic interpretation. Please review the [Collaboration Guidelines](prompts/guidelines/collaboration.md) before submitting additions or modifications.

## Philosophy

We believe that AI-assisted symbolic interpretation must be:
- **Empowering, not deterministic** - Highlighting possibility, not predicting fate
- **Insightful, not prescriptive** - Illuminating themes, not giving instructions
- **Ethical, not exploitative** - Respecting boundaries and human agency
- **Deep, not reductive** - Honoring complexity and mystery
- **Accessible, not elitist** - Making symbolic wisdom available while maintaining integrity

## About Dark Folio Press
