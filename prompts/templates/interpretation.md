Interpret the [ASPECT TYPE] between [PLANET 1] in [SIGN 1] ([HOUSE 1]) and [PLANET 2] in [SIGN 2] ([HOUSE 2]).

Orb: [degrees]
Aspect strength: [tight/moderate/wide]

Please consider:
1. The archetypal relationship between these two planetary principles
2. How the aspect type ([ASPECT]) shapes their interaction
3. The role of signs and houses in expressing this dynamic
4. Potential manifestations in daily life and psychological patterns
5. Both constructive and challenging expressions
6. How to work consciously with this energy

Format as: [narrative/bullet points/dialogue]
```

## Synthesis and Pattern Recognition

### Template: Chart Theme Analysis

```
Analyze the following chart pattern/theme:

Pattern: [e.g., Grand Trine, T-Square, Stellium]
Elements involved: [list planets, signs, houses]

Context:
- Dominant element(s): [Fire/Earth/Air/Water]
- Dominant modality: [Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable]
- Chart ruler: [planet and placement]

Please provide a synthesis that:
1. Identifies the core archetypal theme
2. Explains how the elements work together
3. Discusses the gifts and challenges of this pattern
4. Considers how this theme might manifest across life areas
5. Offers insights for conscious development
6. Maintains nuance and avoids oversimplification

Approach: [holistic/psychological/evolutionary/traditional]
```

## Transit and Timing

### Template: Transit Interpretation

```
Interpret the transit of [TRANSITING PLANET] in [SIGN] to natal [NATAL PLANET] in [SIGN].

Transit type: [conjunction/opposition/square/trine/sextile]
Current orb: [degrees]
Timeframe: [dates when exact, range of influence]

Natal context:
- Natal [PLANET] house: [house number]
- Natal [PLANET] aspects: [list key aspects]
- Overall natal theme related to this planet: [brief description]

Please provide:
1. The archetypal meaning of this transit
2. Potential themes and experiences during this period
3. Both opportunities and challenges
4. Suggested approaches for working with this energy
5. Timeframe considerations (approaching/exact/separating)
6. Integration with natal chart themes

Important: Frame as potential themes, not predictions. Emphasize agency and choice.
```

## Comparative Analysis

### Template: Synastry Aspect

```
Interpret the synastry aspect: Person A's [PLANET] in [SIGN] ([HOUSE]) [ASPECT] Person B's [PLANET] in [SIGN] ([HOUSE]).

Relationship type: [romantic/friendship/professional/family]
Orb: [degrees]

Please analyze:
1. The archetypal interaction between these planetary principles
2. How this aspect influences the relationship dynamic
3. Both harmonious and challenging expressions
4. Growth opportunities for both individuals
5. Suggestions for conscious navigation of this dynamic

Maintain: Respect for both individuals' agency, non-judgmental tone, emphasis on growth.
```

## Question-Specific Interpretation

### Template: Focused Question Reading

```
Question: [specific question from querent]

Relevant chart factors:
- Planets/signs/houses most related to question: [list]
- Key aspects bearing on this question: [list]
- Current transits relevant to this area: [list if applicable]

Please provide:
1. Symbolic analysis of the chart factors related to this question
2. Multiple perspectives on possible approaches or outcomes
3. Themes and patterns that illuminate the question
4. Empowering insights that support decision-making

Ethical reminders:
- Offer insight, not instruction
- Present multiple possibilities
- Respect the querent's autonomy
- Avoid predictions about specific outcomes
- Suggest professional support if question is outside scope (medical, legal, etc.)
```

## Developmental and Evolutionary

### Template: Nodal Axis Interpretation

```
Interpret the nodal axis: South Node in [SIGN] ([HOUSE]) and North Node in [SIGN] ([HOUSE]).

Nodal rulers:
- South Node ruler: [planet] in [sign] ([house])
- North Node ruler: [planet] in [sign] ([house])

Key aspects to nodes: [list]

Please provide an evolutionary interpretation that:
1. Describes the South Node as past patterns, skills, and comfort zones
2. Explores the North Node as evolutionary direction and growth edge
3. Integrates the rulers and their placements
4. Discusses aspects that support or challenge nodal development
5. Offers practical insights for growth and integration
6. Maintains a developmental (not fatalistic) perspective
7. Honors both the gifts of the past and the call of the future

Approach: [evolutionary/spiritual/psychological]
```

## Multi-Layered Integration

### Template: Complex Chart Synthesis

```
Provide a comprehensive interpretation integrating multiple chart factors:

Primary factors:
1. [Factor 1: e.g., Sun-Moon aspect]
2. [Factor 2: e.g., Stellium in 10th house]
3. [Factor 3: e.g., Saturn-Uranus square]

Context:
- Chart owner's focus: [area of interest or question]
- Life stage: [age/phase if relevant]
- Current transits: [if applicable]

Please weave together:
1. How these factors relate to each other
2. Overarching themes and patterns
3. Tensions and harmonies between different parts of the chart
4. A cohesive narrative that honors complexity
5. Both challenges and gifts in the overall pattern
6. Practical insights for conscious living
7. Areas for growth and development
