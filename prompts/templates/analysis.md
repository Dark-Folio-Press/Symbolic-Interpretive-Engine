## Declination and Out-of-Bounds Analysis

**Note:** Declination refers to a planet's distance north or south of the celestial equator (measured in degrees). Parallels occur when two planets have the same declination; contra-parallels occur when they have equal but opposite declinations. Planets are considered "out-of-bounds" when they exceed approximately 23°27' declination.

### Template: Parallel and Out-of-Bounds Study

```
Analyze the following declination factors:

Parallels:

Contra-parallels:

Out-of-bounds planets:
- [Planet] at [degrees] declination

Please explore:
1. How parallels function similarly to conjunctions
2. How contra-parallels function similarly to oppositions  
3. The special significance of out-of-bounds planets
4. How these factors add dimension to the chart interpretation
5. Integration with traditional aspects
6. Notable manifestations of these energies

Note: These factors add depth but should enhance, not replace, traditional analysis.
