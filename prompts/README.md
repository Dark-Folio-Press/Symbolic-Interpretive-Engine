# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

This directory contains a curated collection of prompt engineering documents for the Astro-Interpretative-Engine, a symbolic interpretation system being developed by Dark Folio Press.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as:
- A collaborative workspace for developing and refining prompts
- A knowledge base for symbolic interpretation patterns
- A repository of best practices and guidelines
- A collection of reusable templates and examples

## Getting Started

1. **New to symbolic interpretation?** Start with the [Symbolic Literacy](concepts/symbolic-literacy.md) document
2. **Want to create prompts?** Check out the [Prompt Design Guidelines](guidelines/prompt-design.md)
3. **Looking for examples?** Browse the [Examples](examples/) directory
4. **Ready to contribute?** Read our [Collaboration Guidelines](guidelines/collaboration.md)

## Core Principles

The Astro-Interpretative-Engine is built on these foundational principles:

1. **Symbolic Literacy** - Deep understanding of symbolic systems and their meanings
2. **Ethical Restraint** - Thoughtful boundaries in interpretation and application
3. **Interpretive Depth** - Moving beyond surface-level analysis
4. **Collaborative Evolution** - Continuous refinement through shared knowledge

## Use Cases

This prompt engineering portfolio supports:
- Astrological chart interpretation
- Symbolic pattern recognition
- Archetypal analysis
- Meaningful narrative generation
- Ethical AI-assisted divination

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance our understanding and application of symbolic interpretation. Please review the [Collaboration Guidelines](guidelines/collaboration.md) before submitting additions or modifications.
