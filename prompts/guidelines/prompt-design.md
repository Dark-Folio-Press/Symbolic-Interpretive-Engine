# Prompt Design Guidelines

This guide provides principles and best practices for designing effective prompts for the Astro-Interpretative-Engine.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity of Intent

**Principle:** The prompt should clearly communicate what interpretation or analysis is desired.

**Good:**
```
Interpret Mars in Aries in the 1st house, focusing on:
1. Expression of will and desire
2. Physical energy and vitality
3. Leadership style and initiative
```

**Poor:**
```
Tell me about Mars in Aries.
```

**Why it matters:** Specificity produces focused, useful responses. Vague prompts lead to generic outputs.

### 2. Appropriate Context

**Principle:** Provide enough context for meaningful interpretation without overwhelming detail.

**Essential context:**
- The specific chart element(s) being interpreted
- Relevant aspects or connections
- The question or focus area (if applicable)
- Any special circumstances

**Optional but helpful:**
- Overall chart themes
- Client's life stage or situation
- Specific concerns or interests
- Previous interpretations or readings

**Example:**
```
Context: Client is considering a career change and wants to understand 
their vocational potential.

Interpret:
- 10th house Capricorn stellium (Sun, Mercury, Saturn)
- MC ruler Saturn in the 10th
- North Node in Virgo in the 6th house

Focus on career themes, work style, and vocational calling.
```

### 3. Ethical Boundaries Built-In

**Principle:** Every prompt should encode ethical safeguards appropriate to its purpose.

**Standard ethical reminder:**
```
Please provide an interpretation that:
- Emphasizes potential and possibility rather than fate
- Respects individual agency and free will
- Avoids medical, legal, or financial advice
- Maintains an empowering, constructive tone
```

**Adjust based on content:**
- Health-related: Extra emphasis on non-diagnosis
- Relationship: Respect for all parties' autonomy
- Timing/prediction: Focus on themes, not specific events
- Challenging patterns: Constructive, growth-oriented framing

### 4. Desired Output Specification

**Principle:** Indicate what kind of response you want.

**Format options:**
- Narrative paragraph
- Bullet points
- Structured sections
- Dialogue or Q&A
- Poetic or lyrical
- Technical and precise

**Length guidance:**
- Brief (150-250 words)
- Moderate (300-500 words)
- Detailed (600-1000 words)
- Comprehensive (1000+ words)

**Tone specification:**
- Accessible and friendly
- Poetic and evocative
- Scholarly and precise
- Practical and grounded
- Spiritual and expansive

**Example:**
```
Format: Narrative with clear sections
Length: 500-700 words
Tone: Accessible but not oversimplified, encouraging
```

### 5. Depth and Nuance

**Principle:** Request interpretation that honors symbolic complexity.

**Encourage depth:**
```
Explore multiple manifestations of this placement, including:
- Psychological dimension
- Behavioral patterns
- Growth opportunities
- Potential challenges
- Integration strategies
```

**Avoid reductionism:**
❌ "What does this mean?"
✅ "Explore the archetypal themes and potential expressions of this placement"

**Request synthesis:**
```
Integrate the following factors into a coherent interpretation:
[List elements]

Show how they work together, creating a unified picture.
```

## Structural Components

### Effective Prompt Structure

```markdown
## [Prompt Title/Purpose]

**Context:**
[Background information, chart details, or situation]

**Interpretation request:**
[Specific chart element(s) to interpret]

**Focus areas:**
1. [Specific aspect 1]
2. [Specific aspect 2]
3. [Specific aspect 3]

**Approach:**
[Psychological/Evolutionary/Traditional/etc.]

**Output specifications:**
- Format: [Type]
- Length: [Range]
- Tone: [Quality]

**Ethical boundaries:**
[Relevant reminders for this specific prompt]
```

### Optional Additions

**When helpful:**
- Examples of desired interpretation quality
- Specific questions to address
- Themes to emphasize or avoid
- Comparison to other placements
- Historical or mythological connections

## Common Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Element Interpretation

```
Interpret [ELEMENT] with attention to:
- Archetypal meaning
- Sign expression
- House manifestation
- Aspect integration
- Both gifts and challenges
```

### Pattern 2: Aspect Relationship

```
Analyze the [ASPECT TYPE] between [PLANET 1] and [PLANET 2]:
- The nature of each planet
- How the aspect shapes their relationship
- Potential manifestations
- Integration strategies
```

### Pattern 3: Pattern or Configuration

```
Interpret the [PATTERN NAME]:
- Overall pattern meaning
- Individual components
- The whole greater than parts
- Life implications
- Conscious working with this energy
```

### Pattern 4: Synthesis Request

```
Synthesize the following chart factors:
[List factors]

Create a unified interpretation showing:
- How they relate to each other
- Overarching themes
- The integrated picture
```

### Pattern 5: Question-Focused

```
Question: [Specific question]

Relevant chart factors: [List]

Provide insights that:
- Address the question directly
- Offer multiple perspectives
- Empower decision-making
- Respect autonomy
```

## Refinement Techniques

### Iteration Process

1. **Start with basic prompt** - Get initial response
2. **Identify gaps** - What's missing or unclear?
3. **Add specificity** - Refine instructions
4. **Test revision** - Try the improved prompt
5. **Repeat as needed** - Continue refinement

### Common Improvements

**If output is too generic:**
- Add more context
- Request specific themes
- Ask for concrete examples
- Specify depth of analysis

**If output is too brief:**
- Explicitly request longer response
- Add more areas to explore
- Request elaboration on key points

**If output misses the mark:**
- Clarify your intent
- Provide examples of what you want
- Specify what to avoid
- Check if context is sufficient

**If output lacks nuance:**
- Request multiple perspectives
- Ask for both/and rather than either/or
- Emphasize complexity
- Request synthesis of tensions

## Advanced Techniques

### Layered Prompting

For complex interpretations, layer your prompts:

**Layer 1 - Foundation:**
```
Interpret the basic meaning of [element]
```

**Layer 2 - Context:**
```
Now consider this element within the context of [broader chart theme]
```

**Layer 3 - Integration:**
```
Integrate with [additional factors] to create synthesis
```

### Comparative Prompting

Request comparison to deepen understanding:

```
Compare and contrast:
- Mars in Aries vs. Mars in Libra
- How do these express the Mars archetype differently?
- What can each learn from the other?
```

### Meta-Prompting

Ask for analysis of interpretation approach:

```
After providing the interpretation, explain:
- What considerations guided this interpretation
- What was emphasized and why
- What limitations or uncertainties exist
- Alternative interpretations possible
```

### Contextual Variations

Create variations for different contexts:

```
Interpret [same placement]:
- For a teenager
- For someone in midlife
- For an elder
How does life stage affect manifestation?
```

## Testing Your Prompts

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a prompt, verify:

- [ ] Intent is clear and specific
- [ ] Adequate context is provided
- [ ] Ethical boundaries are included
- [ ] Output format is specified
- [ ] Depth/nuance is requested
- [ ] Length is indicated
- [ ] Tone is specified
- [ ] The prompt is well-organized
- [ ] Instructions are actionable
- [ ] Potential misinterpretations are minimized

### Test Methodology

1. **Use the prompt** with a known chart or scenario
2. **Evaluate the output** against your expectations
3. **Note what works well** for future use
4. **Identify improvements** needed
5. **Revise and retest** until satisfied
6. **Document** the final version

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Too generic | Add specificity and context |
| Too brief | Request longer format, more areas to cover |
| Off-topic | Clarify focus, provide better context |
| Lacks depth | Request multiple perspectives, synthesis |
| Too technical | Specify accessible tone |
| Too simplistic | Request nuanced, complex view |
| Misses ethical boundaries | Add explicit ethical reminders |
| Wrong format | Specify format clearly in prompt |

## Style and Language

### Effective Prompt Language

**Be directive but not rigid:**
✅ "Please explore..."
✅ "Consider..."
✅ "Analyze..."
✅ "Integrate..."

❌ "You must..."
❌ "Only focus on..."

**Request, don't demand:**
✅ "Provide an interpretation that..."
✅ "Please include..."

❌ "Give me..."
❌ "I want..."

**Be specific:**
✅ "Interpret Mars in Aries in the 1st house"
❌ "Interpret this placement"

**Use active voice:**
✅ "Explore how Saturn shapes this dynamic"
❌ "The way Saturn shapes this dynamic should be explored"
