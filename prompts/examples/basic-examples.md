## Tips for Using These Examples

1. **Study the structure** - Notice how prompts are constructed
2. **Observe the tone** - See how language choices matter
3. **Note the ethical framing** - Every example maintains boundaries
4. **Adapt to your needs** - Use as templates, not rigid formulas
5. **Practice variations** - Try different planets, signs, houses
6. **Compare outputs** - Test different phrasings and approaches
7. **Document what works** - Keep track of effective prompts

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "Tell me about Mars in Aries"
✅ **Specific:** "Interpret Mars in Aries in the 1st house, focusing on energy expression and assertion style"

❌ **Deterministic:** "What will happen with this transit?"
✅ **Open:** "What themes might emerge during this transit?"

❌ **No context:** Just asking for an interpretation without any parameters
✅ **Contextualized:** Including chart context, question focus, desired depth

❌ **No ethical boundaries:** Requesting predictions about specific outcomes
✅ **Bounded:** Requesting insights about themes and potentials
